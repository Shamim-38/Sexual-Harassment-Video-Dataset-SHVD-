## üçÄ Overview
### Project Title: Sexual Harassment Detection
#### Contributor: Md Shamimul Islam, Md Mahedi Hasan, Sohaib Abdullah 
#### Description : 

The lack of a comprehensive sexual harassment video dataset (SHVD) poses a substantial obstacle to applying deep learning methods for detecting sexual harassment in public and workplace settings. Addressing this challenge, our project presents the inaugural Sexual Harassment Video Dataset, comprising 300 videos categorized into two classes: harassment and non-harassment scenarios. These videos, sourced from various locations, including online social media platforms, are curated to represent both indoor and outdoor incidents.


In this study, we collected the sexual harassment Dataset (SHVD). We have the following variations on our dataset:
* Class-2 (Harassment and Non-harassment) 
* Collected from various social media platforms
* Dress (different colors)
* Backgroud (Real-life setting)
